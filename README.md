# N_DIMENSIONAL_VECTOR
n_dimensional_Vector

A Python class implementation of an n-dimensional vector with support for basic vector operations such as addition, dot product, cross product, and cloning.

This project demonstrates operator overloading, object-oriented programming, and mathematical abstractions in Python.

âœ¨ Features

âœ… Create vectors of any dimension

âœ… Indexing and assignment (v[i])

âœ… Equality check (==)

âœ… String representation for readability

âœ… Vector addition (+)

âœ… Dot product (@)

âœ… Cross product (for 3D vectors)

âœ… Clone vectors (deep copy)

ðŸ“‚ Class Overview
Attributes

values: list of vector elements

size: number of dimensions

Methods

__init__(*n) â†’ initialize vector with given values

__getitem__(index) â†’ access element by index

__setitem__(index, value) â†’ set element by index

__str__() â†’ string representation

__eq__(other) â†’ check vector equality

__add__(other) â†’ vector addition

__matmul__(other) â†’ dot product

cross_product(other) â†’ cross product (only for 3D)

clone() â†’ create a copy of the vector

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Add scalar multiplication/division

Implement magnitude and normalization

Support advanced vector operations (angle, projection, etc.)
